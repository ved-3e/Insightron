# Insightron Configuration
# This file contains all configuration settings for the Insightron transcription application.
# Modify these settings to customize the behavior of your transcription system.

# ============================================================================
# Model Configuration
# ============================================================================
model:
  # Model name: Whisper model size to use for transcription
  # Options: tiny, base, small, medium, large, large-v2, distil-medium.en, distil-large-v2
  # Smaller models are faster but less accurate. Larger models are slower but more accurate.
  # distil-* models are optimized for speed with minimal accuracy loss.
  # Default: medium (good balance of speed and accuracy)
  name: "medium"
  
  # Compute type: Precision/quantization for model inference
  # Options: float16, int8_float16, int8, float32
  # int8 = fastest, lower memory, slight quality loss
  # float16 = good speed, good quality (requires GPU)
  # float32 = slowest, best quality
  # Default: int8 (recommended for most use cases)
  compute_type: "int8"
  
  # Device: Hardware to run the model on
  # Options: auto, cpu, cuda
  # auto = automatically detect and use GPU if available, otherwise CPU
  # cpu = force CPU usage (slower but works everywhere)
  # cuda = force GPU usage (requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support)
  # Default: auto
  device: "auto"

# ============================================================================
# Runtime Configuration
# ============================================================================
runtime:
  # Transcription folder: Where transcription text files (.md) are saved
  # Use absolute path. Backslashes must be doubled (\\) or use forward slashes (/)
  # Default: D:\2. Areas\Ideaverse\Areas\Insights
  transcription_folder: "D:\\2. Areas\\Ideaverse\\Areas\\Insights"
  
  # Recordings folder: Where audio recordings are saved
  # Use absolute path. Backslashes must be doubled (\\) or use forward slashes (/)
  # Default: D:\2. Areas\Ideaverse\Areas\Recordings
  recordings_folder: "D:\\2. Areas\\Ideaverse\\Areas\\Recordings"
  
  # Maximum file size: Maximum audio file size to process (in megabytes)
  # Files larger than this will be rejected with an error
  # Default: 500 (MB)
  max_file_size_mb: 500
  
  # Log level: Verbosity of logging output
  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  # DEBUG = very verbose (for troubleshooting)
  # INFO = normal operation messages
  # WARNING = only warnings and errors
  # Default: INFO
  log_level: "INFO"
  
  # Worker count: Number of parallel workers for batch processing
  # Set to a specific number (e.g., 4) or leave commented out for auto-detection
  # Auto-detection uses os.cpu_count() to match your CPU cores
  # Higher values = faster batch processing but more CPU/memory usage
  # Default: auto (commented out)
  # worker_count: 4

# ============================================================================
# Realtime Transcription Configuration
# ============================================================================
realtime:
  # Sample rate: Audio sample rate in Hz for realtime recording
  # Options: 8000, 16000, 22050, 44100, 48000
  # 16000 Hz is optimal for Whisper and speech recognition
  # Higher rates increase quality but also processing time and memory
  # Default: 16000
  sample_rate: 16000
  
  # Buffer duration: Size of the audio ring buffer in seconds
  # This is the maximum audio history kept in memory
  # Larger buffer = more context but more memory usage
  # Default: 30 (seconds)
  buffer_duration_seconds: 30
  
  # Chunk duration: Length of audio chunks sent to the model in seconds
  # Larger chunks = better context but slower transcription
  # Smaller chunks = faster but may miss context
  # Default: 5 (seconds)
  chunk_duration_seconds: 5
  
  # Stride: How often to run inference in seconds
  # Smaller stride = more frequent updates but higher CPU usage
  # Larger stride = less frequent updates but lower CPU usage
  # Must be ≤ chunk_duration_seconds
  # Default: 1 (second)
  stride_seconds: 1
  
  # Silence threshold: RMS threshold below which audio is considered silence
  # Range: 0.0 - 1.0 (normalized)
  # Lower values = more sensitive (transcribes quieter audio)
  # Higher values = less sensitive (ignores quiet audio)
  # Default: 0.015
  silence_threshold: 0.015
  
  # Silence duration: Minimum silence duration before stopping transcription
  # Used for automatic recording pause detection
  # Default: 0.5 (seconds)
  silence_duration: 0.5

# ============================================================================
# Post-Processing Configuration
# ============================================================================
post_processing:
  # Enable language detection: Automatically detect the language of transcribed text
  # Currently a placeholder for future feature
  # Default: false
  enable_language_detection: false
  
  # Cache size: LRU cache size for language detection results
  # Higher values = more caching but more memory usage
  # Only relevant if language detection is enabled
  # Default: 128
  cache_size: 128
  
  # Formatting style: How to format transcription output
  # Options: auto, paragraphs, minimal
  # auto = smart paragraph breaks based on content analysis
  # paragraphs = new paragraph every 3 sentences
  # minimal = new paragraph every 5 sentences
  # Default: auto
  formatting_style: "auto"
